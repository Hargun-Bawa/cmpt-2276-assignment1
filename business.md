## Relevant laws
The collection of potentially personally identifiable information varies province to province, country to country. But for the purposes of this document, privacy laws will pertain to British Columbia. As of 2024, collection of personal information falls under the [Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA)](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/00_03063_01). Since data is collected passively, i.e. not via a man in the middle type vector, all data collected is already being transmitted, and not requested. Argument can be made that collection of this type of data falls under implicit consent (section 8) of PIPA and does not require explicit authorization. Collection without consent may also fall under Part 5, Section 12, Subsection 1d or 1e.
